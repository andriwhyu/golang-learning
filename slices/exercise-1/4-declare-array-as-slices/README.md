## EXERCISE: Declare the arrays as slices

1. First run the following program as it is

2. Then change the array declarations to slice declarations

3. Observe whether anything changes or not (on the surface :)).


## EXPECTED OUTPUT
```
names    : []string ["Einstein" "Tesla" "Shepard"]
distances: []int [50 40 75 30 125]
data     : []uint8 [72 69 76 76 79]
ratios   : []float64 [3.14]
alives   : []bool [true false true false]
zero     : []uint8 []
```
