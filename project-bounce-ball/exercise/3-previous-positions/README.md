## EXERCISE: Previous positions

 Let's optimize the program once more. This time you're
 going to optimize the clearing off the previous positions.

 1. Find the code, `main.go`, marked as "remove the previous ball"

 2. Instead of clearing every position on the board to false,
    only set the previous position to false. So, don't use
    a loop, remove it.

 3. Change the velocity of the ball like so:

    vx, vy = 5, 2

 4. Run the program and solve the problem


## HINT

 Don't forget saving the previous position.
